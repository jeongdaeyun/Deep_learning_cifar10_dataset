# Deep_learning_cifar10_dataset

PyTorch models trained on CIFAR-10 dataset

I modified TorchVision official implementation of popular CNN models, and trained those on CIFAR-10 dataset.
I changed number of class, filter size, stride, and padding in the the original code so that it works with CIFAR-10.
I also share the weights of these models, so you can just load the weights and use them.
The code is highly re-producible and readable by using PyTorch-Lightning
